# Siren

Siren is a *Twilio* frontend designed to make **mass text message campaigns** cheaper & more accessible for *non-profit organizations*

Most online *"mass texting"* services, especially those preying on non-profits, use Twilio as their back-end and implement **1,000% and more** *surcharges*.

Some small percentage of this surchage serves to cover their maintenance costs, but the vast majority of it is just to *take advantage* of well-meaning organizations trying to be effective in their outreach.

Siren is a **free & open-source** desktop frontend for Twilio, rather than a web service frontend. As such, there are no maintenance costs. The only cost to the user will be the small fees charged by the Twilio service itself (for most organizations, only a few dollars per month)
